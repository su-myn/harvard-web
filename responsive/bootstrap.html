		Bootstrap even includes a way to make sure that web pages are <mark><strong>mobile responsive</strong></mark> using something called <mark>Bootstrap's column model</mark>. So I'll show you an <mark>example</mark> of that now. Bootstrap divides its page into <mark>12 distinct columns</mark>.
	</div>
	<div>
		So here, for example, I have a whole bunch of divs that are each 3-unit columns. So if I have four 3-unit columns, that will take up a total amount of space equal to 12, meaning filling up the entirety of the screen. So if I now open up source column zero.html, here's what that looks like. I have four columns, each of which is of width 3. And as a result, as I shrink it, those columns will automatically resize to make sure that they're always the appropriate size.
	</div>

	<div>
		<img src="raw/bootstrap3.jpg" height="250">
		<img src="raw/bootstrap4.jpg" height="250">
		<img src="raw/bootstrap5.jpg" height="250">
	</div>
	<div>
		Now, as long as they add up to 12, they don't only to be the same size. So, for example, if I only wanted three columns, instead of four, I could get rid of the fourth column by deleting those rows. And maybe change the second column instead of being a column of size 3, let's make it a column of size 6. So that's a length 6 column instead.

		<img src="raw/bootstrap8.jpg" height="250">
	</div>
	<div>
		Bootstrap also lets me specify how many units that column should take up depending on the <u><strong><mark>size of the screen</mark></strong></u>.
